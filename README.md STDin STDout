If String input command is to be written after numeric commands i.e., either int or double comands 

2nd method:  use----> scan.nextLine();
Reason: scan.nextInt() and scan.nextDouble() read only the numeric part of the input until they encounter a whitespace/character (like space, newline, tab).
The newline character (\n) entered after the double value remains in the input stream (console buffer).
When scan.nextLine() is called in the second code, it immediately reads this leftover newline character as an empty string ("").

CODE:
 Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = scan.nextInt();
        double d=scan.nextDouble();
        scan.nextLine();
        String s = scan.nextLine();
